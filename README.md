# PickACook
The repository to keep track of the progress within the codebase of the application. 

This project aims to create an app for Pick A Cook which is an on-demand booking platform for booking private chefs. The app shall work for both private chefs and customers. Therefore, it will be available in two versions with two different points of views. 

Customer Interface:
First of all the customer must register an account. Then, the customer will be able to insert his/her needs as in - number of people being served, location and kitchen preference. The app will then show a list with all available chefs in the area which the customer can freely choose from. Once chosen a chef of preference, the booking process starts with notifying the chef. 

Chef Interface:
After creating an account on our app, we will send the chef a message with an introduction to a screening process. During the registration process the chef must meet certain requirements in order to be accepted. If the requirements are met, a message will be sent to him. In case of refusal, the reason will be explained and how it can be accepted when reapplying. After successfully completing the screening process, he will receive a welcome package and his account will be opened.
As a chef he will have the possibility to enter his availability at the beginning of the month. This availability must be detected in the system so that the customer can reserve this date with the cook. When a booking is made, the chef will be informed and the booking is then binding. 

The key screens will be 1. the booking screen for the customer in which the customer can choose the preferred kitchen and chef. The 2. key screen will be an overview screen with all bookings for the chef. The screen should show a summary of all bookings with him.

Features:
1. Matching (map): We will need a smart matching process that can recommend certain chefs around an area to the selection of the customer.
2. Booking system: The customer must be able to reserve a slot of the available slots of the chef. The slot must be blocked (and unblocked in case of cancellation).
